# Chat Log

**User:** Review @CLAUDE.md
**User:** For the ChatLog.md ONLY include the user chat items, include no System/Assistant responses.
**User:** Pick up and do CT-1 (check Jira for task)
**User:** It seems like you got stuck, was there any error message from the tool?
**User:** Whitespace only should result in the Continue button in that modal being deactivated - the passphrase cleaner should raise an error that gets caught resulting in the disabling of the continue button.
**User:** Is there a more specific error type we should throw?
* We don't want to create a new error class, just if there was something native like how in python there are different types of exception, then we would do that.**User:** It doesn't appear as if the passphrase cleaner is being applied to the "For reference", this might be a general implementation problem, or there is a DRY issue where the pathway for displaying that and the pathway for actually calculating it for local storage aren't the same.
**User:** Add this test to our tests.
**User:** We need to pull that function out into its own javascript file and have the test and html use that.
**User:** Add a version indicator in a comment to the top of the html file
**User:** Drop the feature list, we just need the version and updated.
**User:** Take the version back to 0.9.0
**User:** You're not getting every command I send into the chat log. Is there a better way to achieve the same aim?
**User:** LOG: Use LOG and update CLAUDE.md to reflect the decision.
**User:** LOG: Add an item to CT, Storage by Zapier reports the UUID we're sending is invalid. Is it possible we're sending something wrong? Double check the substring logic and anything else that sounds out as possibly wrong. Then move that task to inprogress and work the problem:
**User:** LOG: Hold up. The upstream packager for zapier-store-client agreed to make their UUID validation not concern itself with being an actual UUID.
**User:** Disk space issue resolved.
**User:** Let's leave this playright stuff in progress but put a pin in it. Set it off into an appropriately named Jira branch, commit there, then come back to main as of the version at origin right now.
