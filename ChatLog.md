# Chat Log

**User:** Review @CLAUDE.md
**User:** For the ChatLog.md ONLY include the user chat items, include no System/Assistant responses.
**User:** Pick up and do CT-1 (check Jira for task)
**User:** It seems like you got stuck, was there any error message from the tool?
**User:** Whitespace only should result in the Continue button in that modal being deactivated - the passphrase cleaner should raise an error that gets caught resulting in the disabling of the continue button.
**User:** Is there a more specific error type we should throw?
* We don't want to create a new error class, just if there was something native like how in python there are different types of exception, then we would do that.**User:** It doesn't appear as if the passphrase cleaner is being applied to the "For reference", this might be a general implementation problem, or there is a DRY issue where the pathway for displaying that and the pathway for actually calculating it for local storage aren't the same.
